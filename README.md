# PoE2Dire

Extension to rendering Path of Exile patch notes in a Dota2-style layout (Enghlish only at this moment). [For this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1tkazjr/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_ggg_doesnt_present/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

The extension only injects on:

```text
https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/*
```

It still declares access to `poewiki.net` and `poe2wiki.net` for icons lookup.


## How to use?

1. Go to any poe patch note forum page ([like this hot one](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3932540))
2. Click PoE2Dire icon on top to activate it <img width="114" height="79" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b800f16-d7a4-4f35-b4cc-65940e61ee31" /> (if you don't see it, you need to pin it, use mosaic icon, find it, click it there)
3. Done
4. You can click it again to deactivate, or simply reload.


## Dota2 Style Search Feature

> [!NOTE]
> This works only if you installed via Chrome/Firefox extension

The second feature of this extension is the ability to search by just start typing. 
- Yes, just start typing, for example, type `traps`, until you realize `There is no Carol in H.R`. 
- You can click enter to move to the next result. 
- It auto clear after 2 seconds, so you can easily start searching for a new thing next, so try to search for `daggers` next.


## Install options

### Install on Chrome
> please, consider leaving a review, so more people find it!

TBD - Waiting for approval


### Install on Firefox
> consider leaving a review, so more people find it!

[Firefox Browser Add-ons Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/poe2dire/) - Waiting for approval


### Do you guys have phones?

This is for phones or browsers where you cannot/don't want to install the extension. 

> [!NOTE]
> Some mobile browsers can block bookmarklet scripts, so this may not work for everyone, tested on `Android` with `Brave`. Feel free to open an issue, maybe someone would have solution for your case, or at least suggests you a different phone :)

> [!CAUTION]
> This will download the remote code (`https://aisatan.github.io/PoE2Dire/PoE2Dire-bookmarklet.js`) and **execute** it with your browser.
> It's not required - but I **strongly suggest** to stay safe and use the **incognite mode**.

Video installation on my phone (brave browser):

The phone bookmarklet loads the published single-file build from GitHub Pages:

```js
javascript:(function(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.src='https://aisatan.github.io/PoE2Dire/PoE2Dire-bookmarklet.js?poe2dire=' + Date.now();s.referrerPolicy='no-referrer';s.onerror=function(){alert('PoE2Dire failed to load. The page may block bookmarklet scripts.');};document.documentElement.appendChild(s);})();
```

How to use it:

1. Create a browser bookmark (any site will do)
2. Edit the bookmark URL and Name.
3. Paste the full `javascript:` code above as the bookmark URL.
4. Put some easy accessable name, like `0000 poe2dire`
5. Open a Path of Exile forum patch-notes page.
6. Run the bookmark (in the most browsers you can write the name of the bookmark to see and activate it)


## Not working for you?

Feel free to open an issue on github, I will do my best to fix it for you, but no promises.


## Contribution

Please, feel free to ask a question, open PR, issue, or fork it if you want. 
It lacks documentation, but messy js code must be clear enough to follow. 
But, keep in mind, my decades of writing hacky js code might feel strange, cause I never actually used it to make a proper project, only scripts with jQuery.
